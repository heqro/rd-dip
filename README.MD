# RD-DIP: Rician Denoising - Deep Image Prior

*by HR Iglesias-Goldaracena, I. Ram√≠rez & E. Schiavi.*

This repository contains the dependencies, code and datasets for harnessing RD-DIP, a major enhancement for the unsupervised learning Deep Image Prior (DIP) that allows it to perform Rician denoising.

## Getting started

Clone the repository, initialize the modules and install the requirements:

```
git clone git@github.com:heqro/rd-dip.git
cd rd-dip
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive --remote
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is likely that, in the future, the file [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) may refer to software packages that are not obtainable anymore. Strictly speaking, only the following packages were explicitly installed by us for developing and executing the project:

- `torch` with the CUDA 11.8 version.
- `piqa`, used for in-GPU quality measurements.
- `scikit-image`, used for computing SSIM image.

Everything else that appears in the file came installed as dependencies by `pip`.
